I bootstrapped this project with create-react-app.
To run my react todo app:

1. npm install
2. React flip move dependency must also be installed before running.
Command:
yarn add react-flip-move

# Or, if not using yarn:
npm i -S react-flip-move
3. Nodejs and other libraries must be installed first.
